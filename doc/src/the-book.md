# The Scrapelect Book

Welcome to the `scrapelect` book.  `scrapelect` is a declarative
web-scraping language, where you describe how to find data on
a web page and how to filter and process that data, then get output
in a structured, machine-readable format.

`scrapelect` is currently in development, and the language and
interpreter are changing.  This book aims to be up to date with
the latest released version (currently v0.3.0).  If something
is inconsistent or incorrect, please consider submitting an
[issue](https://github.com/suaviloquence/scrapelect/issues/new?labels=documentation)
or pull request to help improve the documentation.
