# Language Concepts

A `scrapelect` program is a sequence of [statements](./statements-and-values.md)
that describes how to turn a web page into structured data.  This description
includes where the data is located on the web page ([elements and selectors](./elements-and-selectors.md))
and how to process that data using [filters](./filters.md) to get the structured
output that you desire.

`scrapelect` is in beta, so it's possible that changes to the language on the `dev`
branch may not be reflected yet in this book.  The information should be correct
for the latest released version (v0.3.2).  If the documentation is incorrect or
could be improved, consider filing an [issue](https://github.com/suaviloquence/scrapelect/issues/new?labels=documentation)
or pull request, as `scrapelect` is an open source project.
